Hamming Distance Calculation:

	1. Script: final_numpy_Sakib_logiclocking_merged_entropy_normal_nominal.py
	2. The script is set up currently only for the test.bench (ALU) file from the Benchmark directory
	3. Hamming distance value can be measure either for full circuit or selective opcode mode
	4. Select mode=1 in the script, provide "ctrl_val" for a particular operation. Guide for control values are given in the comments in the script
	5. Provide your own results directory to the result_dir variable

	run the script using python3. Results file should be generated in the results directory. Results indicate 3 different HD value calculated using different techniques
